### Hi there 👋

I'm an engineering student that's crazy about improving work performance through automation jobs, especially in finance where I feel at home where we have loads of data to work on. I specialize in:
* Microsoft 365 and its wide suite of apps.
* Programming languages, such as Python, to do automation and analysis.
* Financial concepts, to better understand companies in financial markets.

In other words, I'm a financial operations generalist who can improve financial departments to a more smooth way of operating.

I have chosen this career path through a combination of 2 years working as an apprentice in car factories where I developed a good view of process improvement, 3 years (and counting) as a consultant for small companies in administrative processes + 1 year as a volunteer student in administrative operations on a project at my university. The consultancy I provide focuses on developing management systems with tools that you probably use (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365) to optimize how your company/department works.

Viewing a lot of companies in a wide range of sectors, I have been able to develop an open mind to innovation, helping me improve my work and colleagues! Feel free to contact me here on LinkedIn
